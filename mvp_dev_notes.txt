To Do
------------------
[ x ] - 01 : Run rails server and check it works without issue.
[ x ] - 02 : Install capybara gem and run simple test on homepage.
[  ] - 03 : Build html structure (no tests)
[  ] - 04 : Feature: view all works ongoing and not started.

02- Install Capybara and run test:
- Adding rspec-rails gem
  - added `gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 6.0.0'` to Gemfile in development and test environments
  - run `bundle install`
    -*- Error: Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "actionpack"
      -> Looks like there is a conflict between version 6.0.6 and > 6.1 for the actionpack gem.
      -> Looking on stack overflow for similar threads.
        -> found this one: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50098395/rails-5-bundler-could-not-find-compatible-versions-for-gem-actionpack
        - overcome the issue by removing versioning of rspec-rails.
  - run `rails generate rspec:install`
  - running a simple rspec test to prove that RSpec runs okay.
- Installing and setting up Capybara
  - added gem 'capybara' to Gemfile.
  - added basic test for visiting root and finding the word John El Basha
  - ran `rails g controller PAGES main`
  -*- Error: Failure/Error: <%= javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
    ->        Your manifest contains: {}
    -> This is a very common error/problem. Looking on StackOverflow
    -> solution was (I think) a combination of node version and needing run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install`
  
03- Build html structure
